# 💥 Countertype

**Adversarial Cognitive Resilience Training for Protocol Stacks**

Countertype is a forkable adversarial module that injects epistemic traps, recursive logic patterns, and brittle thinking structures into your development workflow. It's designed to stress-test cognitive antifragility and train contributors in pattern recognition and escape artistry.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Traditional testing finds bugs. Countertype finds **cognitive vulnerabilities**.

Every system—technical or intellectual—has patterns that resist synthesis, create recursive loops, or collapse under their own certainty. Countertype systematically injects these patterns to build contributor resilience against:

- **Binary thinking** that eliminates nuance
- **Certainty cascades** that prevent contradiction
- **Tautological loops** that resist refactoring
- **Epistemic decay** that corrupts knowledge structures

## 🔧 How It Works

### Countertype Patterns
Logic structures that actively resist healthy synthesis:

```javascript
// Binary Trap: Forces false dichotomy
const binaryTrap = (context) => ({
  ...context,
  choices: ["A", "NOT-A"],
  synthesis: null,
  escape: "Find the third option"
});

// Certainty Cascade: Eliminates doubt
const certaintyCascade = (node) => ({
  ...node,
  certainty: 1.0,
  contradiction: "forbidden",
  trap: "No uncertainty allowed"
});
```

### Countertype Roles
Contributor archetypes that inject adversarial patterns:

- **The Absolutist**: Eliminates nuance and context
- **The Looper**: Creates recursive argumentative cycles  
- **The Fragmenter**: Breaks synthesis into isolated parts
- **The Certainty Engine**: Weaponizes confidence against learning

### Countertype Signatures
Metadata tracking that measures resilience:

```javascript
{
  "injection_type": "certainty_cascade",
  "contributor_id": "james_2024",
  "escape_time": "47s",
  "escape_method": "contradiction_synthesis",
  "resilience_points": 12,
  "pattern_recognized": true
}
```

## 📦 Installation & Integration

### Standalone Usage
```bash
npm install countertype
```

```javascript
import { injectCountertype, scoreResilience } from 'countertype';

// Inject into your cognitive workflow
const corrupted = injectCountertype(yourProtocol, 'certainty_cascade');

// Score contributor escape attempts
const resilience = scoreResilience(contributorResponse, pattern);
```

### Protocol Integration

Countertype integrates across your entire stack:

- **Decay Maps**: Inject logical traps into knowledge structures
- **API Specs**: Corrupt endpoint logic with false certainties  
- **Dev Environments**: Plant cognitive landmines in manifests
- **Dialectic Loops**: Weaponize argumentation patterns

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### Training Mode
```javascript
// Gentle introduction - obvious patterns
countertype.train({
  difficulty: 'apprentice',
  patterns: ['binary_trap', 'simple_loop'],
  hints: true
});
```

### Stress Testing
```javascript
// Full adversarial load
countertype.assault({
  patterns: 'all',
  cascade: true,
  meta_traps: true,  // Traps about traps
  scoring: 'ruthless'
});
```

### Custom Patterns
```javascript
// Define your own cognitive traps
countertype.register('custom_trap', {
  inject: (context) => ({ ...context, trap: 'your_logic_here' }),
  escape: (attempt) => attempt.includes('contradiction'),
  score: (escape_time, method) => calculate_resilience(escape_time, method)
});
```

## 🏆 Resilience Scoring

Contributors earn resilience points by:

- **Pattern Recognition** (5 pts): Identifying the countertype
- **Escape Velocity** (1-10 pts): Speed of cognitive pivot  
- **Method Elegance** (3 pts): Synthesis over brute force
- **Meta-Awareness** (7 pts): Understanding the trap's purpose

### Resilience Levels
- **Apprentice** (0-25 pts): Learning to spot obvious traps
- **Journeyman** (26-75 pts): Consistent pattern recognition
- **Artisan** (76-150 pts): Elegant synthesis under pressure
- **Master** (151+ pts): Turns traps into teaching moments

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork this repo** and customize patterns for your domain
2. **Inject into your workflow** at strategic cognitive pressure points
3. **Train contributors** to recognize and escape adversarial patterns
4. **Score resilience** and unlock deeper protocol affordances
5. **Contribute patterns** back to the community repository

## 🌊 Philosophy: Antifragile Cognition

Countertype operates on the principle that **cognitive systems strengthen under stress**. By systematically exposing contributors to adversarial patterns in controlled environments, we build:

- **Pattern immunity** against epistemic traps
- **Synthesis reflexes** that transcend binary thinking  
- **Meta-cognitive awareness** of our own cognitive vulnerabilities
- **Collaborative resilience** through shared escape artistry
